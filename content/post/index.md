**Acaleph** is the storage solution used in CloudBlocks. Its primary focus is to deliver unified storage platform for the digital enterprise. Built on revolutionary [Ceph](http://www.ceph.com/) technology, Acaleph aims to deliver the key components of reliable storage:

-	**Unified** – Effectively unifies all storage hardware by making use of Ceph’s Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store (RADOS) which enables Acaleph servers to provide object, block, and file system storage in a single unified storage cluster.

-	**Scalable** – Intelligently replicate data as needed.

-	**Efficient** – Storing data efficiently by strategically using SSD drives and store sequential pieces of data across several storage devices.

Acaleph’s main user interface is the Acaleph Dashboard. The Dashboard allows administrators to monitor cluster health, manage their storage settings, and administrate users and permissions. The Acaleph Dashboard has powerful tools allowing organizations to manage their data cluster according to their specific needs.

The key features of the Acaleph Dashboard will be covered in the next few chapters of this document, allowing users to understand the capability of this solution.
